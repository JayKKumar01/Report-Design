# 📝 Report Design - Interactive Image Comparison Tool

**Report Design** is a clean, interactive web-based tool that allows users to visually compare two images — typically a reference design and its implementation — using a real-time **magnifying glass** (zoom lens). It's designed for document reviewers, testers, designers, and developers who want to verify fine-grain visual differences efficiently.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Interactive Zoom Lens**  
  Hover over either image to magnify content using a circular zoom lens that follows your cursor.
  
- 📄 **Side-by-Side Comparison**  
  A split-view layout with a main image on the left and a scrollable report image on the right.

- 📜 **Scroll-Aware Zooming**  
  The lens remains aligned to the correct image position even while scrolling vertically through tall reports.

- ⚡ **Optimized Performance**  
  Lightweight code and rendering logic ensure smooth behavior even on low-end devices.

- 🎨 **Clean UI**  
  Uses modern HTML/CSS layout with no external frameworks or libraries.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **HTML5** — Structured layout and image embedding
- **CSS3** — Flexbox layout, lens styling, and responsiveness
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — Real-time interaction logic and scroll handling

## ⚙️ Customization

* Replace `mainImage` and `reportImage` `src` attributes in `index.html` to use your own images.
* Adjust `zoomFactor` or `circleSize` in `script.js` to tweak zoom level and lens size.
* Style the magnifier further in `style.css` (e.g., border, shadow, shape).
